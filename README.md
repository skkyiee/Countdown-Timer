# Countdown-Timer Web Application

## Overview

This is a simple countdown timer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to set a specific date and time in the future, and it will count down to that moment, displaying the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. When the countdown reaches zero, a sound alarm will play to notify the user.

## Features

- **Set Countdown**: Users can input a specific date and time for the countdown.
- **Multiple Timers**: Users can set and display multiple countdown timers on the same page.
- **Real-time Updates**: The countdown timer updates in real-time using JavaScript's `setInterval()` function.
- **Alarm Sound**: An audio alarm plays when the countdown reaches zero.
- **Responsive Design**: The timer is styled with CSS and is responsive across different devices.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the appearance and functionality of the timer using CSS and JavaScript.
